                Hey, I'm Aadvait! I was born in India, raised in Dubai, and I'm now studying Computer Science and Business at Indiana University, Bloomington. I specialize in full-stack web development using TypeScript, Next.js, tRPC, Prisma, Supabase etc. I've built membership systems, internal dashboards, and end-to-end products integrating authentication, payments, and data pipelines. I've also traveled across the U.S. for hackathons, pitch competitions, and startup conferences, where I learned how to prototype fast, validate ideas, and communicate technical work to both users and investors.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                My main interest lies in the mechanics of building and scaling software businesses: how developer tools and SaaS startups acquire their first customers, close B2B contracts, price their product, and measure performance through metrics like CAC, LTV, retention, and churn. I use YC, ODF, Z-Fellows companies as case studies to learn about early-stage growth strategy, like equity allocation, fundraising structure, onboarding optimization, and how cold outreach and distribution drive adoption.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Coming to the research side, I work in the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (DSAIL) at the Kelley School of Business, collaborating with Indiana University's Open Source Ecosystems (OSE) team on the NSF SAFE-OSE project â€” "Implementing AI-Enabled Vulnerability Management Practices to Enhance Safety and Security of Open Source Cloud Computing Ecosystems." My project contributes to benchmarking vulnerabilities produced by LLMs across IDEs, programming languages, and prompt variations, mapping CWE patterns to understand the security risks of AI-generated code.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Outside of research and startups, I lead Kappa Theta Pi at IU, the largest professional technology fraternity in the U.S., with 70+ members at IU. I'm also a Luddy Direct Admit, Hutton Honors Scholar, and Global Engagement Scholar supported by over $52,000 in scholarships. When I'm not building or researching, I'm probably playing the guitar, copying a Bob Ross painting, or at a McDonald's.
